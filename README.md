# CanvasSnake
Work in progress to convert a one-off game created for fun into
a package that can then be included on any page with a Canvas DOM element to start a game of snake.

It also will eventually have a way to store the scores to a local file or have the option to post to a file
so that it can be integrated with an existing DB.
